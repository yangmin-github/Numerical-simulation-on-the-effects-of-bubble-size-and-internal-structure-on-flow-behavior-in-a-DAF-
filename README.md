# Although dissolved air flotation (DAF) plays a crucial role in wastewater treatment, fluid dynamics in the DAF tank are still considered black-box processes, which hampers DAFâ€™s optimal design and operation. In this article, we perform a modeling study to further unravel the governing mechanisms occurring in a
DAF tank. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with a generic population balance model (PBM) for the DAF system was developed in this work. By establishing a synergy between fluid dynamics
and bubble size to achieve the best CZ efficiency, the generic CFD-PBM approach developed in this study has laid a solid basis for the optimal design and operation of DAF systems.
